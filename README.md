A python code developed to check the plagiarism within a directory. I developed this code when I was a teaching assisstant in one of courses during my PhD, when we came to know that there was mass copying in the lab codes. 

The code saves the plagiarism report as a csv file, which includes names of files and their similarity. 

Note:
Have been tested only with files of the format .m, .txt, .c, .h, .cpp, .json ...
You are open to test with other file formats as well.

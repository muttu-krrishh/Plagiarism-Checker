A Python code developed to check the plagiarism within a directory. I developed this code when I was a teaching assistant in one of the courses during my PhD. 

The code saves the plagiarism report as a csv file, which includes names of files and their similarity. 

Similarity ranges from 0 with no similarity, to 1 with verbatim.

Note:
Have been tested only with files of the format .m, .txt, .c, .h, .cpp, .json ...
You are open to testing with other file formats as well.
